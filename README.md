This project set out to faciliate the conversion of FITS image data into sound and has culminated in a user-friendly GUI, developed in python. 

Access the YouTube tutorial here **(in progress)** or this repository's Wiki **(in progress)** for specific setup instructions and details on the various interface features!

See the requirements_soni.txt file to reference the required packages & versions in order to successfully run the main script.

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION! PLEASE RETURN PERIODICALLY TO CHECK FOR UPDATES.**
